We present an ensemble learning approach inpainting model for face inpainting. The used dataset can be downloaded from here https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1VGlK2ym0gI9bS-4rTLx-uL-jMHWMO5HQ?usp=sharing,
the binary masks to delete some regions can be found here https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/19CXiaFdaKhLNtvTJTRSNXf5UvXUp8x4t?usp=sharing. 
We also used self-supervised learning for not using binary masks but real and syntethic occlusors, such real occlusor dataset is shared here https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1SoosnSGwbHYWGx_4Luj9YHPrXHPkcEqo?usp=sharing
Besides, we trained our model with a smaller dataset that involves different classes https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/11Biz2qc2iC8s2XdiaOKCCNm3fFAGwbtX?usp=sharing

In order to train our model, we recommend to attend the README.txt file.
